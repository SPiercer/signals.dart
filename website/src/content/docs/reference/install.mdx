Signals can run anywhere Dart can run including VM, WASM, Dart to JS, Dart to Native, Flutter, and on the server.

:::note
Signals is a single package that contains the imports for flutter and dart and may not show the correct platforms on pub.dev (doesn't show dart only).

`Signals.dart` is available on pub.dev:
